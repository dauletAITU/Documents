      <h1 class="movie-name">Captain America: The First Avenger (2011)</h1> <br>
      <p class="movie-d">Captain America is the fifth Marvel Studios film, but it's the first film on our list because the events take place first - during World War II. Recognized as unfit for military service, Steve Rogers volunteers to take part in a top secret research project that turns him into Captain America, a superhero dedicated to defending American ideals. We see the creation of the super-soldier portrayed by Chris Evans, as well as his first battle with Hydra and its leader Red Skull. The film also introduces the Tesseract, which we later discover is the first Infinity Stone, one of the powerful gems that control reality.</p>

      <h1 class="movie-name">Captain Marvel (2019)</h1> <br>
      <p class="movie-d">The second film on our list hit theatres in 2019. In Captain Marvel, which is set in 1995, we see the titular hero Carol Danvers, played by Brie Larson, fall to Earth and begin a hunt for the shape-shifting Skrull aliens. There’s as much action here as there is nostalgia, especially if you're a 90s kid, thanks to scenes with Blockbuster stores and even dial-up internet.<p>

      <h1 class="movie-name">Iron Man (2008)</h1> <br>
      <p class="movie-d">According to the official Marvel timeline, Iron Man takes place in 2010. It's all about genius/inventor/philanthropist/playboy Tony Stark, played by Robert Downey Jr. He is captured by a terrorist organization, the leader of which wants the latest weapons system designed by Stark. However, Stark designs something even more powerful to help himself escape: The first Iron Man suit.<p>

      <h1 class="movie-name">Iron Man 2 (2010)</h1> <br>
      <p class="movie-d">The second Iron Man picks up where the first left off: Tony Stark grappling with his Iron Man identity being revealed. The government wants the technology behind his suit, and when Stark refuses to hand it over, another weapons manufacturer shows he’s willing to do anything to get his hands on it. This film also introduces fellow Avengers the Black Widow and War Machine.<p>

      <h1 class="movie-name">The Incredible Hulk (2008)</h1> <br>
      <p class="movie-d">The Incredible Hulk follows Bruce Banner on the run from General Thunderbolt Ross and the US Military. Realising he can’t ever hope to control or contain the Hulk, Ross decides to create his own version of the Hulk using another soldier, but he quickly loses control. The Incredible Hulk stars Edward Norton, but Mark Ruffalo replaced him in 2012 and has been the big green man since.<p>

      <h1 class="movie-name">Thor (2011)</h1> <br>
      <p class="movie-d">The God of lightning has been banished to Earth from Asgard by his father Odin, all thanks to the trickery of Loki. In order to earn his powers back and control his hammer, Thor, portrayed by Chris Hemsworth, must prove he’s worthy. Luckily, he meets a nice Earth scientist, played by Natalie Portman, who can help him set things right before Loki assumes total control of Asgard.<p>

      <h1 class="movie-name">The Avengers (2012)</h1> <br>
      <p class="movie-d">The Avengers is the culmination of the so-called "Phase One" of the MCU. With all the main heroes introduced, the real challenge was finding something daunting enough to force them to work together. The combined power of Loki, the Tesseract, and an alien horde invading New York City proved to be the match that made these superheroes become friends in life and on the frontline.<p>
      <img src = "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/pv-target-images/5f89ffdd1e14d9fa17136724b0cb33801a27c0e05686d4e8c617aafeeb3ded3c._RI_V_TTW_.jpg" alt="Iron man3" width="660" height="440">
      <h1 class="movie-name">Iron Man 3 (2013)</h1> <br>
      <p class="movie-d">The third and final standalone Iron Man film takes place six months after the giant fight in New York City. Tony Stark is dealing with the memories of the battle that took place (and nearly killed him). The memories lead him to build an army of Iron Man suits so he can always be prepared.<p>

      <h1 class="movie-name">Thor: The Dark World (2013)</h1> <br>
      <p class="movie-d">The second Thor film sees its hero return to Asgard after the Loki-led invasion of New York City. He doesn’t have much time to rest, however, as the ancient Dark Elves return. They were once defeated by his grandfather and thought to be extinct. They're back now and seeking the Aether, a powerful weapon that is later revealed to be an Infinity Stone, or one of six powerful gems in the MCU.<p>
